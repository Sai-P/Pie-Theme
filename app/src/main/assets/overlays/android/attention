// If your device is a Pixel, you will have to manually change the Device Theme in Settings/Display/Device Theme in order for the theme to fully apply in certain areas of the system. Please remember to manually set the device theme to Pixel again before disabling Android System overlays if you don't want to be met by Teal.\n\n// Select only the variant of the theme appropriate to your Android version. Bugging me about user error won't get you anywhere.\n\n// If you encounter any legitimate bugs, please send me the logchar as prompted by the error dialogue.\n\n// If you see unthemed/improperly themed elements, please reboot your device and make sure the correct variants of each overlay are properly applied. If the issues still exist, send me screenshots by email or feel free to open an issue on my Github repo.
