### Issues Tracker

__IMPORTANT: Do the necessary reading before doing anything with this theme. I will not help you if your "issue" stems simply from not sparing a single minute to read instructions that are readily available here, within the theme, and on the Play Store listing.__

Try to be as clear as possible, provide additional information such as screenshots and logs if needed. Please use proper English and stay on topic. Off-topic or non-english/non-understandable issues will be closed ASAP. If you have any issues that cannot be resolved by simply doing the necessary reading, open a GitHub issue or contact me directly through email or Telegram.
